- File Operations
    - Grabs raw audio data from file and sends it
        - keeps track of audio meta data
- DSP Stage
    - Performs primitive and somewhat advanced DSP operations on the raw audio
        - frequency domain - fft, wavelet transform, filtering, etc
        - time domain - running rms, instantaneous power, etc
- Mood Machine
    - Uses the primitive DSP information to characterize the audio events
        - mood machine (machine learning?)
        - beats per minute
        - scale detection
- Translation Unit
    - Translates the detected mood and audio events into visual events
        - color palette 
        - animation reactivity - how intensely the visuals react
        - 

View
    - Update the View according
